## 🎨 Design Philosophy

1. **Beauty is not optional** – Every interaction should feel delightful
2. **AI serves humans** – Technology amplifies, doesn't replace human curation
3. **Privacy first** – User data is sacred
4. **Fast by default** – <100ms interactions, instant feedback
5. **Progressive disclosure** – Simple surface, powerful depths
